# Playing with play-with-docker

Some files put together to play with play-with-docker (PWD)

[play-with-docker](https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker):

> Play With Docker gives you the experience of having a free Alpine Linux Virtual Machine in the cloud
> where you can build and run Docker containers and even create clusters with Docker features like Swarm Mode.
> 
> Under the hood DIND or Docker-in-Docker is used to give the effect of multiple VMs/PCs.
> 
> A live version is available at: http://play-with-docker.com/
